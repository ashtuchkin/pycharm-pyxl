Pyxl Extensions for PyCharm
===========================

This PyCharm plugin aims to provide extensions to PyCharm for working with [Pyxl](https://github.com/dropbox/pyxl) files.

Currently one action is available: **Goto Pyxl definition** which navigates to the Python implementation of the Pyxl tag under the cursor. The default keyboard shortcut is `Cmd-Shift-B` (on Mac). Also available under the "Tools" menu.
